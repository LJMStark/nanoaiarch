Arch AI uses advanced AI image generation technology optimized specifically for architectural visualization. This guide will help you maximize its capabilities.

## AI Rendering Engine

Arch AI uses the latest Gemini 3 Pro image model, optimized for architectural scenes:

- **Material Understanding** - Accurately recognizes and renders wood, concrete, glass, metal, and other building materials
- **Lighting Simulation** - Realistic daylight, artificial lighting, and ambient light effects
- **Spatial Awareness** - Understands architectural proportions and spatial relationships
- **Style Transfer** - Supports multiple architectural style renderings

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Reference Materials

High-quality reference materials significantly improve results:

**Sketch Requirements**
- Clear lines with well-defined main structures
- Use black lines on white or light backgrounds
- Can include simple annotations

**White Model Requirements**
- Ensure complete model without broken surfaces
- Choose appropriate viewing angle for screenshots
- Can add simple environment (ground, sky)

**Floor Plan Requirements**
- Clear functional zone annotations
- Include door and window positions
- Correct scale proportions

### Step 2: Write Description Prompts

Good prompts are key to achieving ideal results:

**Basic Structure**
```
[Building Type] + [Style] + [Materials] + [Environment] + [Atmosphere]
```

**Example**
```
Three-story modern villa, minimalist style,
white concrete exterior with large floor-to-ceiling glass windows,
surrounded by Japanese zen garden,
warm golden light at dusk, professional architectural photography
```

**Prompt Tips**

| Type | Good Examples | Bad Examples |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Style | Modern minimalist, Neo-Chinese, Nordic | Nice, pretty |
| Material | Exposed concrete, walnut veneer | Premium materials |
| Lighting | Evening sidelight, overcast soft light | Brighter |
| Angle | Eye-level perspective, aerial view | Good angle |

### Step 3: Select Quality

Choose quality based on use case:

| Quality | Resolution | Generation Time | Recommended For |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1K | 1024px | ~10s | Quick preview, scheme comparison |
| 2K | 2048px | ~20s | Presentations, web sharing |
| 4K | 4096px | ~40s | Formal output, print |

### Step 4: Iterate and Refine

After initial generation, continue optimizing through conversation:

```
User: Change the exterior to warm wood finish
AI: [Generates new rendering]

User: Keep the wood but switch to darker walnut tone
AI: [Generates new rendering]

User: Great, now add some rooftop greenery
AI: [Generates final rendering]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Image References

Upload multiple reference images for more precise results:

- **Image 1** - Building mass (white model or sketch)
- **Image 2** - Material reference (real photos)
- **Image 3** - Atmosphere reference (preferred rendering style)

### Aspect Ratios

Choose appropriate aspect ratios:

- **16:9** - Horizontal panorama, ideal for exterior views
- **9:16** - Vertical composition, ideal for towers or lobbies
- **1:1** - Square format, ideal for social media
- **4:3** - Traditional ratio, ideal for print

### Negative Prompts

Describe elements you don't want:

```
Modern office building design, no traditional Chinese elements,
avoid overly complex decoration, no exaggerated colors
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why doesn't the result match expectations?

- Check if prompts are specific enough
- Ensure reference images are clear and well-defined
- Try step-by-step descriptions, establish direction first then refine details

### Q: How to maintain consistent style across multiple images?

- Use the same style description words
- Maintain similar lighting and atmosphere settings
- Generate consecutively in the same conversation

### Q: What if I run out of credits?

- Preview with 1K quality first
- Generate HD version only after satisfaction
- Purchase credit packages for better value

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then refine** - Establish overall effect first, then adjust details
2. **Save intermediate results** - Download satisfactory renderings promptly
3. **Build a library** - Collect excellent references and prompt templates
4. **Use conversation** - Break complex modifications into multiple descriptions
