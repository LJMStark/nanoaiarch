This is normal content that should render correctly.

## Normal Section

Here's some normal content with a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Error Test Section

The component below will throw an error to test the ErrorBoundary:

export const BrokenComponent = () => {
  throw new Error('Test error: ErrorBoundary is working!');
  return <div>This will never render</div>;
};

<BrokenComponent />

## This Should Not Appear

If you see this text, the ErrorBoundary failed to catch the error and the entire page crashed.
