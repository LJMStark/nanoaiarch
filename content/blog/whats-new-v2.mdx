We're excited to announce a major update to Arch AI! This release brings a completely new conversational editing experience and project management system to make your architectural visualization workflow smoother.

## Feature Highlights

### 🗣️ Conversational Editing

Say goodbye to single-generation limitations. Now you can continuously refine your renderings like chatting with a design assistant:

**Workflow Example**

```
You: A modern minimalist three-story villa with white exterior

AI: [Generates initial draft]

You: Change the roof to flat and add a terrace

AI: [Modifies based on previous image]

You: Add a swimming pool in the front yard

AI: [Continues refining]

You: Perfect! Change the sky to warm sunset tones

AI: [Final rendering]
```

Each conversation builds on the previous result, making iteration easier than ever.

### 📁 Project Management

All generation records are automatically organized into projects, allowing you to:

- **Track Progress** - View the complete evolution of each design concept
- **Compare Versions** - Side-by-side viewing of different stages
- **Quick Rollback** - Return to any previous satisfactory version to continue editing
- **Batch Export** - One-click download of all renderings in a project

### 🔄 Generation State Recovery

Accidentally close the browser or lose network connection? Don't worry:

- Automatic progress saving
- Auto-recovery when reopening
- No work in progress will be lost
- No duplicate charges

### 📱 Multi-Image Reference Upload

Now supports uploading multiple reference images simultaneously:

| Type | Purpose | Limit |
|------|---------|-------|
| Mass Reference | Building form and spatial relationships | 1-2 images |
| Material Reference | Material texture and color | 1-3 images |
| Style Reference | Overall atmosphere and style | 1-2 images |

AI comprehensively understands all reference images to generate renderings that combine the best of each.

## Interface Improvements

### New Creation Interface

- **Larger Preview Area** - Clearer rendering display
- **Sidebar Organization** - Neatly categorized settings and history
- **Quick Actions** - One-click access to common features
- **Dark Mode** - Protect your eyes, focus on design

### Smart Suggestions

The input box intelligently recommends based on your references and history:

- Common style descriptions
- Matching material suggestions
- Suitable lighting atmospheres
- Popular aspect ratios

## Performance Improvements

### Faster Generation Speed

| Quality | Before | Now | Improvement |
|---------|--------|-----|-------------|
| 1K | ~15s | ~10s | 33% |
| 2K | ~30s | ~20s | 33% |
| 4K | ~60s | ~40s | 33% |

### More Stable Service

- Optimized server architecture
- Added automatic failure recovery
- Improved response speed during peak hours

## Usage Tips

### Maximize Conversational Editing

1. **Establish Direction First** - Use first generation to set overall style
2. **Step-by-Step Modifications** - Change only one or two elements at a time
3. **Leverage Context** - AI remembers previous conversation content
4. **Be Specific** - Use concrete position descriptions like "the window on the left"

### Efficient Project Management

1. **Separate by Scheme** - Manage different design concepts in separate projects
2. **Name Promptly** - Give projects meaningful names
3. **Mark Important Versions** - Favorite satisfactory renderings
4. **Regular Cleanup** - Delete unneeded test images

## Coming Soon

We're developing more exciting features:

- **Style Template Library** - One-click apply professional designer style presets
- **Batch Generation** - Automatically generate multiple viewpoints for the same scheme
- **Video Walkthrough** - Generate architectural walkthrough animations from renderings
- **Team Collaboration** - Share projects and comments with colleagues
