Stop building from scratch. MKSaaS gives you everything you need to launch a SaaS product in days, not months.

## Why MKSaaS?

Every SaaS product needs the same foundation: user authentication, payment processing, database management, internationalization, and a modern UI. Building these from scratch takes weeks. MKSaaS gives you a head start with a production-ready template you can customize.

## What's Included

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Email/password + social login (Google, GitHub) |
| **Payments** | Stripe integration with subscriptions and one-time purchases |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM |
| **AI Features** | Image generation with multiple providers |
| **i18n** | English and Chinese support out of the box |
| **UI Components** | Radix UI + TailwindCSS |

## Quick Start

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mksaas/mksaas-template.git
cd mksaas-template
pnpm install
```

Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and you're ready to build.
