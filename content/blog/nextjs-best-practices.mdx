AI architectural visualization is transforming how designers work. This article compiles best practices from professional architects using Arch AI.

## Material Preparation

### Golden Rules for Sketches

Quality sketches are the foundation for great renderings:

**Line Treatment**
- Use clear, black lines
- Bold lines for main structures
- Keep auxiliary lines fine and delicate
- Avoid excessive correction marks

**Composition Tips**
- Choose angles that best express design intent
- Maintain appropriate white space
- Center important elements or follow the rule of thirds
- Consider the final rendering aspect ratio

**Annotation Techniques**
- Simple material labels help AI understand intent
- Include approximate scale proportions
- Add text notes for special design features

### Best Practices for White Models

When exporting white models from 3D software:

| Software | Recommended Settings | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| SketchUp | Set style to "Hidden Line" | Turn off shadows for cleaner outlines |
| Rhino | Use "Arctic" display mode | Ensure surfaces are complete |
| Revit | Hide all annotations and labels | Choose appropriate detail level |
| Blender | Render with Eevee white material | Add simple ambient lighting |

**Viewpoint Selection**
- Eye-level height around 1.6m (5'3")
- Maintain appropriate perspective
- Avoid extreme wide-angle or telephoto effects
- Ensure main architectural elements are fully visible

## Prompt Techniques

### Structured Descriptions

Organize your prompts in this order:

```
1. Building type and scale
2. Architectural style
3. Main materials
4. Environment and setting
5. Lighting and atmosphere
6. Photography style
```

**Complete Example**

```
Two-story modern residence,
minimalist style with exposed concrete walls and large glass curtain walls,
situated on a hillside surrounded by conifer forest,
golden evening sunlight streaming from the side,
professional architectural photography, wide-angle lens, high clarity
```

### Style Vocabulary Library

Build a collection of common style descriptions:

**Architectural Styles**
- Modern minimalist / Minimalism / Bauhaus
- Neo-Chinese / Zen / Wabi-sabi
- Nordic / Scandinavian
- Industrial / Loft / Post-modern
- Mediterranean / Tuscan / Colonial

**Material Descriptions**
- Exposed concrete / Textured concrete / Precast concrete
- Walnut / Oak / Cedar / Bamboo
- Ultra-clear glass / Frosted glass / Low-E glass
- Corten steel / Anodized aluminum / Copper panels

**Atmosphere Descriptions**
- Golden hour warmth / Blue hour / Harsh midday sun
- Overcast soft light / Morning mist / Fresh after rain
- Warm and cozy / Cool and modern / Serene and zen-like

## Workflow

### Exploration Phase

Generate multiple directions quickly:

1. Use 1K quality to save time
2. Try different style directions each time
3. Save promising versions
4. Collect client feedback

### Development Phase

After establishing direction, dive into details:

1. Switch to 2K quality
2. Gradually optimize details through conversation
3. Try different material combinations
4. Adjust lighting and atmosphere

### Final Output Phase

Polish the final results:

1. Use 4K quality
2. Ensure every detail meets expectations
3. Generate multiple viewpoints
4. Export high-resolution files

## Common Scene Handling

### Interior Spaces

Special techniques for interior renderings:

- Clearly describe space function (living room, bedroom, office)
- Specify main furniture style
- Note light source positions (windows, fixtures)
- Consider soft furnishing styles

```
Modern minimalist open-plan living room,
3.5m ceiling height, floor-to-ceiling windows facing garden,
gray fabric sofa with walnut coffee table,
afternoon sunlight streaming through windows, warm and cozy atmosphere
```

### Night Scenes

Key points for night renderings:

- Emphasize building lighting effects
- Describe light glowing from interiors
- Consider landscape lighting
- Pay attention to sky treatment

```
Modern villa at night,
warm yellow interior light glowing through glass curtain walls,
ground-embedded lights outlining landscape features,
deep blue night sky, distant city lights faintly visible
```

### Bird's Eye Views

Considerations for aerial perspectives:

- Specify viewing height and angle
- Describe surrounding environment
- Note overall building group relationships
- Consider landscaping and roads

```
Residential district aerial view,
45-degree overhead angle, approximately 100m height,
12 staggered modern residential towers,
central landscape park with artificial lake,
surrounded by city roads and commercial facilities
```

## Quality Control

### Checklist

After generating renderings, confirm:

- [ ] Building proportions are correct
- [ ] Materials render as expected
- [ ] Light and shadow relationships are logical
- [ ] Environmental elements are harmonious
- [ ] Overall atmosphere is appropriate

### Common Issue Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Distorted proportions | Specify building scale in prompts |
| Incorrect materials | Use more specific material description words |
| Strange lighting | Specify exact time and direction |
| Blurry details | Increase quality or generate in steps |

## Efficiency Tips

### Build a Template Library

Create prompt templates for common scenarios:

- Residential (villas, apartments, townhouses)
- Commercial (offices, malls, hotels)
- Public (schools, hospitals, cultural centers)
- Landscape (parks, plazas, courtyards)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Master platform features:

- Copy previous prompts for quick modifications
- Use favorites to save satisfying results
- Batch download all images in a project

## Summary

AI architectural visualization is a tool—creativity still comes from the designer. Master these techniques and let Arch AI become your powerful assistant for efficient design expression.

Keep practicing, keep summarizing, and you'll find your rendering quality continuously improving.
