## Writing Effective Prompts

### Structure

A good prompt includes:
1. **Subject** - What you're visualizing
2. **Style** - Architectural style or aesthetic
3. **Materials** - Specific materials and finishes
4. **Lighting** - Time of day, lighting conditions
5. **Atmosphere** - Mood and environment

### Example Prompts

**Exterior**
> "A contemporary villa with clean geometric lines, white stucco walls, floor-to-ceiling windows, surrounded by Mediterranean landscape, golden hour lighting, photorealistic render"

**Interior**
> "Minimalist living room with concrete floors, white walls, large sectional sofa in gray, floor lamp, large windows overlooking mountains, natural daylight, warm atmosphere"

**Sketch to Render**
> "Transform this architectural sketch into a photorealistic render, modern residential building, glass and steel, urban setting, dramatic sky"

## Conversational Editing

After generating an image, you can refine it through chat:

### Supported Modifications
- Change lighting conditions
- Add or remove elements
- Adjust materials and colors
- Modify atmosphere
- Change perspective

### Example Commands
- "Make it evening with warm interior lights"
- "Add more vegetation around the building"
- "Change the roof to a green roof"
- "Make the windows larger"

## Templates

### Style Transfer
Transform sketches or simple models into styled renders.

### White Model
Create clean architectural model visualizations.

### Interior Design
Visualize room layouts and interior spaces.

### Floor Plan Render
Convert 2D floor plans to 3D visualizations.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - Vague prompts produce generic results
2. **Reference real styles** - Mention architects or buildings
3. **Describe materials** - Concrete, glass, wood, steel
4. **Set the mood** - Time of day, weather, season
5. **Iterate** - Use chat to refine progressively
